Greetings and welcome to my personal research site! Please feel free to explore the links at the top to learn more about my work and background, access my resume and CV, or see some coding examples. 

Current status
======
In March 2024, I defended my Ph.D. dissertation in physics at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://grad.gatech.edu/events/phd-defense-aaron-stahl). My thesis explores magnetospheric plasma physics at Jupiter's moon, Ganymede, using sophisticated, parallelized computational models of the moon's interaction with the Jovian magnetosphere. I have also published peer-reviewed articles on electron radiation belts at Ganymede and the plasma dynamics of Jupiter's moon, Europa, during its encounter with ESA's Juno spacecraft in 2022.

I'm currently working as a research scientist at Georgia Tech with Professor Sven Simon, furthering my research in space plasma (energetic neutral atoms at Ganymede) and developing AI-driven tools for harvesting social media content for sentiment classification. Please contact me if you're interested in any of my work.
