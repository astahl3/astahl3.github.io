Greetings and welcome to my personal research site! Please feel free to explore the links at the top to learn more about my work and background, access my resume and CV, or see some coding examples. 

PhD Defense
======
In March 2024, I defended my Ph.D. thesis in physics at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://grad.gatech.edu/events/phd-defense-aaron-stahl). The research explores magnetospheric plasma physics at Jupiter's moon, Ganymede, using sophisticated, parallelized computational models of the moon's interaction with the Jovian magnetosphere. Much of the work is summarized in my recently published study, ["A Model of Ganymede's Magnetic and Plasma Environment During the Juno PJ34 Flyby"](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023JA032113) in the _Journal of Geophysical Research - Space Physics_. I have also recently published peer-reviewed articles on the plasma dynamics of Jupiter's moon, Europa, during its encounter with ESA's Juno spacecraft in 2022 ([Magnetic Signatures of the Interaction Between Europa and Jupiter's Magnetosphere During the Juno Flyby](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GL106810)) and on the formation of trapped electron radiation belts at Ganymede (recently accepted to _Geophysical Review Letters_, link forthcoming).

Current Status
======
As of April 2024, I am a Research Affiliate at Georgia Tech, working with Professor Sven Simon to further our group's research into space plasma and magnetospheric physics. Currently, I'm investigating how the perturbed electromagnetic environment near Ganymede couples to the behavior of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) in the vicinity of the moon. Additionally, I'm developing AI-driven tools for harvesting social media content for sentiment classification (e.g., NLP and GPT models), trade signals for market securities, and network cluster analysis. 

Please reach out ([aaron.m.stahl@gmail.com](mailto:aaron.m.stahl@gmail.com)) if you're interested in any of my work. You can also learn more about my previous research projects through the links at the top of the page.

ENA Imaging
======
Historically, all space-based measurements of electric and magnetic fields are limited to single lines through 3-D space (i.e., along isolated spacecraft trajectories). As a result, these observations provide only a limited snapshot in time and space, and tell us little about the 3-D structures and the physical processes underlying the observations. ENA images, on the other hand, are 2-D measurements of global ENA emissions. Due to the coupling between ENAs and their surrounding electromagnetic environment, these images can also be viewed as 2-D "photographs" of the magnetic field. The European Space Agency's JUICE spacecraft, which is scheduled to enter into orbit around Ganymede in 2034, is equipped with an ENA camera that will provide thousands of these images. Therefore, it is critical to understand the coupling dynamics between ENAs and their surrounding electromagnetic environment. Such understanding can provide us with the ability to translate the raw data to 2-D pictures of the magentic field.
