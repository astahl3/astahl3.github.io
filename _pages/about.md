Greetings and welcome to my personal research site! Please feel free to explore the links at the top of the page to learn more about my work and background, access my resume and CV, or review some educational primers.

PhD Defense
======
In March 2024, I defended my Ph.D. thesis in physics at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://grad.gatech.edu/events/phd-defense-aaron-stahl). The research explores magnetospheric plasma physics at Jupiter's moon, Ganymede, using sophisticated, highly parallelized computational models of the moon's interaction with the Jovian magnetosphere. Much of the work is summarized in my recently published study, ["A Model of Ganymede's Magnetic and Plasma Environment During the Juno PJ34 Flyby"](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023JA032113) in the _Journal of Geophysical Research - Space Physics_. I have also recently published peer-reviewed articles on the plasma dynamics of Jupiter's moon, Europa, during its encounter with ESA's Juno spacecraft in 2022 ([Magnetic Signatures of the Interaction Between Europa and Jupiter's Magnetosphere During the Juno Flyby](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GL106810)) and on the formation of trapped electron radiation belts at Ganymede (in draft at _Geophysical Review Letters_, link forthcoming).

Current Status
======
As of May 2024, I am a Research Affiliate at Georgia Tech, working with Professor Sven Simon to continue advancing our group's research efforts in space plasma and magnetospheric physics. Currently, I'm investigating how the perturbed electromagnetic environment near Ganymede couples to the behavior of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) in the vicinity of the moon. Additionally, I'm pursuing other research efforts related to my background in investment management and interest in machine learning. Specifically, I am creating AI-driven tools to harvest social media content for sentiment classification (e.g., via various NLP / GPT models) and to build trade signals for market securities.

Please reach out ([aaron.m.stahl@gmail.com](mailto:aaron.m.stahl@gmail.com)) if you're interested in any of my work. You can also learn more about my research projects via the links at the top of the page.
