Greetings and welcome to my personal research site! I'm currently working as a research affiliate at Georgia Tech, where I collaborate with the [Magnetospheres in the Outer Solar System](https://svensimon.gatech.edu/) research group and Professor Sven Simon to study space plasma physics within our solar system. 

Owing to an earlier bachelor's degree in finance from the University of Southern California and a few years of work experience within the investment management sector, I'm also exploring how I can apply my technical background and AI to solve practical, interesting problems in investing and portfolio management. I'm a deeply curious person with broad research interests spanning quantum physics, space physics, and finance.

I'm also an avid musician and guitarist, lover of CRPGs, and a husband and father of two. Please feel free to explore the links at the top of the site to learn more about my work and background, access my resume and CV, or review some educational primers I've written on various research topics.

PhD Defense and Recent Publications
======
In March 2024, I defended my Ph.D. thesis in physics at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://grad.gatech.edu/events/phd-defense-aaron-stahl). The research explores magnetospheric plasma physics at Jupiter's moon, Ganymede, using sophisticated, highly parallelized computational models of the moon's interaction with the Jovian magnetosphere. Much of the work is summarized in my recently published study, ["A Model of Ganymede's Magnetic and Plasma Environment During the Juno PJ34 Flyby"](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023JA032113) in the _Journal of Geophysical Research - Space Physics_. I have also recently published peer-reviewed articles on the plasma dynamics of Jupiter's moon, Europa, during its encounter with ESA's Juno spacecraft in 2022 ([Magnetic Signatures of the Interaction Between Europa and Jupiter's Magnetosphere During the Juno Flyby](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GL106810)) and the presence of electron radiation belts at Ganymede ([On the Formation of Trapped Electron Radiation Belts at Ganymede](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024GL109058)).

Current Status
======
As of May 2024, I am a Research Affiliate at Georgia Tech, working with Professor Sven Simon to continue advancing our group's research efforts in space plasma and magnetospheric physics. Within this space, I'm currently investigating how the perturbed electromagnetic environment near Ganymede couples to the behavior of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) in the vicinity of the moon. As mentioned above, I'm also concurrently pursuing other research related to my background in investment management and interest in machine learning. Specifically, I am formulating AI-driven tools to harvest social media content for sentiment classification trends in retail investing (e.g., via various NLP / GPT models) and to build trade signals for market securities.
