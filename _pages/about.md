Greetings and welcome to my personal research site! I recently completed a PhD in computational physics (May 2024) and I'm working as a Research Affiliate at Georgia Tech, where I collaborate with the [Magnetospheres in the Outer Solar System](https://svensimon.gatech.edu/) research group and Professor Sven Simon to study space physics within our solar system. 

Before diving into computational physics, I got my bachelor’s degree in Business from USC, concentrating in Investments and Financial Markets. After graduating, I spent five years in asset management, mostly as an analyst at Strategic Investment Group, a boutique investment manager. My passion for finance never faded, so I’m also exploring topics in finance and investing that take advantage of my advanced technical background and Georgia Tech's vast resources, including using machine learning and AI to model behavioral patterns in retail investors. I’m a deeply curious person with a broad range of interests, from quantum mechanics and space physics to finance and investments to programming and AI to social media and big data.

I'm also an avid musician and guitarist, lover of CRPGs, and a husband and father of two. Please feel free to explore the links at the top of the site to learn more about my work and background, access my resume and CV, and/or review some educational primers I've written on my research topics. 

Thank you for visiting!

PhD Defense and Recent Publications
======
In Spring 2024, I defended my PhD dissertation in physics at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://grad.gatech.edu/events/phd-defense-aaron-stahl). My research explores magnetospheric plasma physics at Jupiter's moon, Ganymede, using sophisticated, highly parallelized computational models of the moon's interaction with the Jovian magnetosphere. Much of the work is summarized in my recently published study, ["A Model of Ganymede's Magnetic and Plasma Environment During the Juno PJ34 Flyby"](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023JA032113) in the _Journal of Geophysical Research - Space Physics_. I have also recently published peer-reviewed articles on the plasma dynamics of Jupiter's moon, Europa, during its encounter with ESA's Juno spacecraft in 2022 ([Magnetic Signatures of the Interaction Between Europa and Jupiter's Magnetosphere During the Juno Flyby](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GL106810)) and the presence of electron radiation belts at Ganymede ([On the Formation of Trapped Electron Radiation Belts at Ganymede](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2024GL109058)).

Current Status (May '24)
======
I am a Research Affiliate at the Georgia Institute of Technology, working with Professor Sven Simon and the Magnetospheres in the Outer Solar System (MOSS) research group to continue advancing the group's research efforts in space plasma and magnetospheric physics. I'm currently investigating how the perturbed electromagnetic environment near Ganymede couples to the behavior of energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) in the vicinity of the moon. As mentioned above, I'm also concurrently pursuing research related to my background in investment management and financial markets.
