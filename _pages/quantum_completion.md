In the world of big data, where we appear to have information about anything and everything, it might seem surprising that many datasets are overwhelmingly *incomplete*. For example, consider the space of [collaborative filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering) algorithms, where a subset of user preferences are known, but we would like to predict user preferences for the *unknown* subset as well.

An infamous example of collaborative filtering is the [Netflix problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize), where Netflix offered a cash prize to develop the best collaborative filtering algorithm for predicting user film ratings. Historically, most Netflix users rate well below 1% of the company's entire film catalogue, yet we can accurately predict individual user ratings for all films using only this small sampling. Generally, the problem of trying to "complete" a data set from a subset of known entries (i.e., data completion) is referred to as matrix (2-dimensional) or tensor (N-dimensional) completion. Collaborative filtering problems, such as the Netflix problem, comprise a subset of all data completion problems.

Quantum Wavefunction Completion
======
**Project motivations**: In quantum many-body physics, various sampling-based numerical schemes exist (e.g., quantum Monte Carlo) for characterizing quantum states. However, we can possibly improve certain methods by allowing them to "skip to the end" from a limited subset of known wavefunction coefficients, effectively revealing all of the unreliable or missing coefficient values. Such a configuration comprises a data completion problem inside the [Hilbert space](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HilbertSpace.html) of quantum wavefunctions. Here is a simple graphicial representation of what quantum (or wavefunction) completion might look like:

While solutions to this problem have worthy use-cases within computational quantum physics, they may also have interesting applications in other areas of data science. The interconnected nature of wavefunctions is a common phenomena in big data, and effective algorithms for wavefunction completion are therefore likely to prove useful in other settings as well (e.g., image completion; see results below).

**Programming**: While working as a graduate research scientist with Professor Glen Evenbly at Georgia Tech, I designed and programmed several novel solutions to quantum state completion using Python and Matlab. In addition to programming algorithms based on tensor network methods (e.g., randomly structured tensor trees, matrix product states), I also developed an independent solution using stacked convolutional neural networks trained with supervised learning. The latter represents a new use-case for AI and machine learning. Some of my findings are discussed in-depth in the article [Reconstruction of Randomly Sampled Quantum Wavefunctions using Tensor Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01628) (currently under review). Implementations of these methods and code demos are available in Python on my [Github page](https://github.com/astahl3).

The figure below demonstrates how one of my tensor completion algorithms is deployed. This method is applicable to finite quantum states on 1-D lattices with open boundary conditions. In this approach, matrix product states are used to approximate the unknown wavefunction coefficient values. Critically, (1) the approximate or "trial" wavefunction is anchored to the subset of randomly sampled coefficients (i.e., true values), and (2) the bond dimension \\(\chi\\) between tensors is sequentially incremented from the smallest non-trivial value (\\(\chi=d\\), where \\(d\\) is the local dimension of each lattice site).

*The trial wavefunction (top-right) is initialized with the sum of a random sampling of wavefunction coefficient amplitudes and an initial guess of zero for the missing or unknown coefficients (left). Next, the trial wavefunction is decomposed with truncated singular value decompositions (see (1) TSVDs) to form a matrix product state (bottom right). This state is used to update the values of the unknown coefficients (see (2) update), which is then superposed with the known values to form a new trial wavefunction. The algorithm converges in each bond dimension \\(\chi\\), where \\(\chi\\) reflects the dimensionality between each tensor in the matrix product state, before it is incremented to the next bond dimension \\(\chi=\chi+1\\).*

**Results**: Both the neural and tensor network solutions for wavefunction completion demonstrate attractive congergence properties and robust reliability. Low-energy quantum wavefunctions can be completed using either paradigm with near-perfect consistency given a sufficiently large random sample of known wavefunction coefficients. To see what this looks like in practice, consider the sequence below:

![2-D Quantum Completion Visual](../files/quantum/wavefunction_completion_example.png)

The three images above each display a 2-D representation of quantum wavefunction coefficient amplitudes. To start, the true wavefunction (left) is calculated by performing an exact numerical diagonalization of the system's Hamiltonian (see [exactDiagEx.py](https://github.com/astahl3/wavefunction_completion/blob/main/exactDiagEx.py) for the code implementation). Next, 5% of the wavefunction coefficients are sampled (center). Finally, the wavefunction completion routine is applied to restore (or "complete") the unknown coefficients (right). From a human persepctive, it would appear that there is not nearly enough information in the 2-D representation to accurately complete the state (i.e., see middle panel - would you be able to restore the state from just this sampling?). This is largely correct and therefore *matrix* completion algorithms, which confine the data to a fixed 2-D shape, do not work effectively on quantum states. In order to restore the wavefunction from such a small subset of coefficients, the completion algorithm must utilize all non-trivial bipartitions of the state, performing truncated decompositions across each partition and updating the missing values accordingly.

While working on this project, I became interested in deploying my wavefunction completion algorithms for conventional image completion (i.e., an image where a subset of pixels are damaged or missing). By repurposes the algorithm to operate on 2-D images instead of N-D tensors, I was able to achieve results like this:

![2-D Image Completion Visual](../files/quantum/image_completion_example.png)

I found that *locally* reshaping an image into more than two dimensions provided additional information for missing pixels, allowing for superior image completion. While the rudimentary adaptation of my algorithm is computationally inefficient relative to existing image completion routines, this tensor-based approach yields accuracies (e.g., PSNR, RMSE) that are competitive with the best existing methods. Research into wavefunction completion via tensor and neural networks is still in its infancy, but as I demonstrated here, it is a tractable problem and its solutions may have compelling use-cases in the broader arena of data science.
